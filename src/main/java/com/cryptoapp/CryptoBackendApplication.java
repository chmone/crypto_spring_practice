/**
 * üöÄ MAIN SPRING BOOT APPLICATION CLASS - THE HEART OF OUR APPLICATION
 * 
 * ==== WHAT IS SPRING BOOT? ====
 * Spring Boot is a Java framework that makes it SUPER EASY to create web applications.
 * Think of it like a pre-built kitchen - instead of building everything from scratch,
 * you get all the tools and appliances ready to use!
 * 
 * ==== WHAT DOES THIS CLASS DO? ====
 * This class is the "main entry point" - like the front door of your house.
 * When you start the application, THIS is the first thing that runs.
 * 
 * ==== KEY SPRING BOOT FEATURES WE'RE USING ====
 * 1. AUTO-CONFIGURATION: Spring Boot automatically sets up common things like:
 *    - Web server (Tomcat) to handle HTTP requests
 *    - Database connections
 *    - JSON parsing for REST APIs
 *    - Security features
 * 
 * 2. DEPENDENCY INJECTION: Spring Boot automatically creates and manages objects for us
 *    - We don't have to manually create Controllers, Services, Repositories
 *    - Spring Boot creates them and "injects" them where needed
 * 
 * 3. COMPONENT SCANNING: Spring Boot automatically finds all our classes marked with
 *    annotations like @Controller, @Service, @Repository and manages them
 * 
 * 4. EMBEDDED WEB SERVER: No need to install Apache Tomcat separately!
 *    Spring Boot includes its own web server that starts automatically
 */

// ==== SPRING BOOT ANNOTATIONS EXPLAINED ====

/**
 * @SpringBootApplication - THIS IS THE MAGIC ANNOTATION! ü™Ñ
 * 
 *                        This ONE annotation is actually THREE annotations
 *                        combined:
 * 
 *                        1. @Configuration - Tells Spring this class can define
 *                        beans (objects Spring manages)
 *                        2. @EnableAutoConfiguration - Tells Spring to
 *                        automatically configure everything
 *                        3. @ComponentScan - Tells Spring to scan this package
 *                        and sub-packages for components
 * 
 *                        Think of it as telling Spring: "Hey, this is the main
 *                        class, start here and
 *                        automatically set up everything you need!"

/**
 * @EnableScheduling - ENABLES BACKGROUND TASKS üïí
 * 
 *                   This tells Spring Boot: "I want to run some tasks
 *                   automatically in the background"
 *                   For example: Every 45 seconds, fetch new cryptocurrency
 *                   prices from CoinMarketCap
 * 
 *                   Without this annotation, our @Scheduled methods in
 *                   CryptoService wouldn't work!

     * THE MAIN METHOD - WHERE EVERYTHING STARTS! üé¨
     * 
     * This is just like any regular Java application - it all starts with main()
     * But instead of doing everything ourselves, we let SpringApplication.run()
     * handle all the heavy lifting for us!
     * 
     * WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SpringApplication.run() EXECUTES:
     * 1. Creates an "Application Context" (Spring's container for all objects)
     * 2. Scans for all classes with Spring annotations (@Controller, @Service,
     * etc.)
     * 3. Creates instances of these classes and wires them together
     * 4. Starts the embedded Tomcat web server (usually on port 8080)
     * 5. Sets up all the auto-configurations (database, web layer, etc.)
     * 6. Your application is now ready to receive HTTP requests!

         * all your application objects (Controllers, Services, Repositories)
         * 
         * 2. COMPONENT SCANNING: Looks through all your packages for classes marked
         * with:
         * - @RestController (handles web requests)
         * - @Service (business logic)
         * - @Repository (database access)
         * - @Component (general Spring-managed objects)
         * - @Configuration (configuration classes)
         * 
         * 3. DEPENDENCY INJECTION: Creates instances of these classes and automatically
         * "injects" them into each other where needed (using @Autowired)
         * 
         * 4. AUTO-CONFIGURATION: Based on what's in your classpath (dependencies in
         * pom.xml),
         * Spring Boot automatically configures:
         * - Web layer (for REST APIs)
         * - Database layer (JPA, connection pooling)
         * - JSON serialization/deserialization
         * - Error handling
         * - Security (if Spring Security is included)
         * - And much more!
         * 
         * 5. STARTS EMBEDDED WEB SERVER: Usually Tomcat on port 8080
         * Now your application can receive HTTP requests!
